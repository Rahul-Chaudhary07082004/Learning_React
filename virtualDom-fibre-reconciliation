1. Virtual Dom :- Its lightweight, in-memory representation of the real browser DOM. Its just plain js object that describe what the UI should look like.
Manipulating the real DOM is slow. React avoids unnecessary DOM work by:
Creating a Virtual DOM tree
Updating that tree when state/props change
Comparing it with the previous tree
Updating only the parts of the real DOM that actually changed

2. Reconciliation :- the process that react uses to compare the old virtual dom with the new one and decide what changed. 
This comparison is often called diffing.
Reconciliaton produce a list of updates (called effects) that will be later be applied to the real DOM.

3. Fibre :- Its react internal rendering engine.
not the virtual dom , its a system that control how and when reconciliation work happens.

ONE LINE SUMMARY 
1. virtual dom :- what the ui looks like 
2. reconciliation :- finding what changed 
3. fibre:- scheduling and controlling the work efficienlty
